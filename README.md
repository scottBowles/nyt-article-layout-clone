This is a clone of a New York Times article page, found here: https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html

This was done as a project from The Odin's Project's curriculum (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/positioning-and-floating-elements)

The page is not meant to have any functionality and is not responsive. It was completed as html/css practice, primarily for positioning.

The font isn't the same as the NYT font in the original and there are nitpicks to be found, but I was able to use a variety of positioning methods, including flexbox and grid, relative and absolute positioning and a float, and I gained experience with css selectors and navigating selector specificity.
